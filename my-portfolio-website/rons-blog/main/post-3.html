                        In this post, I’m going to walk you through the process of building a simple weather dashboard application using Python. This project involved interacting with a weather API, working with cloud storage (AWS S3), and tackling some common development challenges
                        along the way. It was quite a journey, and I’m excited to share the details with you. The repository can be found at-------------->https://github.com/Nightwalka/weather-app.git
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4"> Project Overview</h2>

                    <p>
                        The goal of this project was to create a command-line application that:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="color:#18a3c4">
                        <li>Fetches current weather data for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.</li>
                        <li>Saves this data as JSON files in an AWS S3 bucket.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This project serves as a good example of how to use Python for data retrieval, API interaction, cloud service integration, and basic programming concepts.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 1: Project Setup and Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did was to set up the project structure. This involved creating a root folder named <code>get-your-job</code> and a subfolder within it named <code>weather-dashboard</code>. I also structured this project using
                        a standard pattern, so the file structure looked like this:
                    </p>
                    <pre style="color:#18a3c4">
                        <code>
get-your-job/
    weather-dashboard/
        data/          # To store any local data files (not used in final version)
        src/           # To store the Python source code
        test/          # To store any test scripts (not used in final version)
        .env            # To store sensitive information
        README.md        # Documentation for the project
        requirements.txt # Listing the libraries this project uses.
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        I created an empty <code>data</code> directory which could be used to save local files, and an empty <code>test</code> directory which could be used to save python test files for this project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>.env</code> file would be used to store environment variables like API keys and bucket names. The <code>README.md</code> would contain documentation for the project, and <code>requirements.txt</code> would contain all
                        of the libraries to be used for this project.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 2: Setting up the .gitignore and requirements.txt Files</h2>
                    <p>
                        Next, I created the <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>requirements.txt</code> files. The <code>.gitignore</code> would prevent files such as the <code>.env</code> file from accidentally being committed to Git. To start, I used
                        the <code>echo</code> command to add <code>.env</code>, <code>__pycache__/</code> and <code>*.zip</code> to my <code>.gitignore</code> file:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.zip" >> .gitignore
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        This ensures the <code>.env</code> file containing private keys, Python's generated cache files, and any zip files are not committed to the repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then I added the specific libraries that would be needed for this project to <code>requirements.txt</code> by using the <code>echo</code> command:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
echo "boto3==1.26.137" >> requirements.txt
echo "python-dotenv==1.0.0" >> requirements.txt
echo "requests==2.28.2" >> requirements.txt
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        This file contains the names and the specific versions of all required Python libraries needed for the project, to ensure consistency when this project is run on different systems.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 3: Installing Dependencies</h2>

                    <p>
                        With the <code>requirements.txt</code> file created, I used <code>pip</code> to install all of the libraries listed:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
pip install -r requirements.txt
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        This command downloads and installs the required libraries into my python environment. It was at this stage that I started to encounter my first challenge.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 4: Initial Coding and First Major Challenge: <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code></h2>
                    <p>
                        I began writing the Python code for the application in the <code>src/weather_dashboard.py</code> file and attempted to run the code using the command:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
python src/weather_dashboard.py
                         </code>
                     </pre>

                    <p>
                        However, I immediately encountered a <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'heapq'</code> error. This was strange, as `heapq` is part of Python's standard library and should be available by default.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="color:#18a3c4">The Troubleshooting Journey:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Initial Analysis:</strong> I verified my Python version using <code>python --version</code>, which confirmed I was using Python 3.8.0.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Minimal Test Script:</strong> I created a minimal test script to check if `heapq` could be imported directly. This test also failed, confirming the problem was not with my specific python code, but with the python environment
                            I was using.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Python Installation Issue:</strong> The repeated failures indicated that my Python installation was corrupted. I uninstalled my current python 3.8 installation, and reinstalled it. However, this did not fix the problem.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        At this point it was becoming clear I had more than one installation of python on my computer, and I was not always certain which one was being used.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 5: Environment Confusion and Multiple Python Versions</h2>
                    <p>
                        After reinstalling python 3.8, the <code>heapq</code> error persisted, and I found that the python libraries were now being installed into my python 3.9.0 installation at <code>c:\users\legion\appdata\local\programs\python\python39\lib\site-packages</code>.
                        This was happening even when I was running the <code>pip</code> command from the python 3.8 environment, which indicated that pip was using the incorrect python installation.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="color:#18a3c4">The Troubleshooting Journey:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>VS Code Investigation:</strong> I investigated the VS code environment and discovered VS code was using the python 3.8 environment, while the command line was calling python 3.9.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Trying Different Versions of Python:</strong> I tried calling different versions of python using various commands such as <code>python3</code>, <code>python3.8</code> and an explicit path, all while receiving different
                            errors.
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Multiple Python Installations:</strong> It was clear that there were multiple versions of Python on my system. I attempted to use the same installation in both the command prompt and in VS code, however, this did not fix
                            the issue.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 6: Deleting All Other Python Installations</h2>
                    <p>
                        After hours of attempting to debug these environment issues, I made the decision to completely uninstall all python installations on my computer, except for python 3.9. This would ensure that there was only one python version present, and therefore any
                        issues would not be related to the presence of multiple versions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After deleting the other python versions, I was then able to configure VS Code to use the python 3.9 interpreter, and use the command line python interpreter for python 3.9. At this point the output of <code>python --version</code>                        and <code>pip --version</code> matched, as well as <code>python3 --version</code> and <code>pip3 --version</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This step alone did not completely fix the problem, as the python libraries were still not found, but it was necessary to proceed to the next step.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 7: Introduction to Virtual Environments</h2>
                    <p>
                        At this point, VS Code suggested I use a virtual environment, to isolate my dependencies from the global environment. This is the standard way of managing python environments, so I followed this advice, and learned about this concept. I used the following
                        commands:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
python -m venv .venv
                         </code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>
                        Then I activated the virtual environment:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
.venv\Scripts\activate
                         </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        This created an isolated environment for my project's dependencies. It was at this point that I understood that I would need to install my libraries again, as they are not installed in this new virtual environment. I installed them using the command:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
pip install -r requirements.txt
                         </code>
                     </pre>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, this command did not work in this shell, as I was not using a <code>source</code> command.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 8: Correct Path Issues and Syntax Issues</h2>
                    <p>
                        After creating the virtual environment, I was then faced with errors that were related to my use of the wrong path syntax. Specifically I was trying to use:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
.venv\Scripts\activate
                         </code>
                     </pre>
                    <p>
                        instead of the correct bash syntax for activating a virtual environment which is:

                        I also had an error related to how I was calling my python scripts. I was trying to specify the entire path of python with the filename <code>C:\Users\LEGION\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe src/weather_dashboard.py</code>.

                    <p>
                        Instead I learned that I must simply call the script using either the <code>python</code> or the <code>python3</code> command and specify the relative path to my python file, such as:

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 9: Resolving the S3 Bucket Creation Error and API Key Issues</h2>
                    <p>
                        Finally, with the environmental issues out of the way, I ran my script, and was finally able to create the S3 bucket. However, when attempting to get data from the open weather API, I was then faced with a new issue related to a <code>401 Unauthorized</code>                        error. I also received an error related to creating a bucket: <code>IllegalLocationConstraintException</code>.
                    </p>

                    <h3 style="color:#18a3c4">The Troubleshooting Journey:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>API Key Problem:</strong> The 401 error meant that I had not properly set up the <code>OPENWEATHER_API_KEY</code> environment variable. To fix this I had to set the environment variable in my <code>.env</code> file as a
                            key value pair like so:
                            <pre class="terminal-like">
                        <code>
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
                             </code>
                            </pre> Note that <code>your_api_key_here</code> must be replaced with the actual API key.</li>
                        <li> <strong>S3 Bucket Issue:</strong> The <code>IllegalLocationConstraintException</code> meant I was attempting to create an S3 bucket using a default region that was not specified by my AWS cli installation. To fix this I had to
                            specify the region by making a small modification to my <code>weather_dashboard.py</code> file in the <code>create_bucket_if_not_exists</code> function, by adding a `LocationConstraint` parameter to the `create_bucket` command:
                            <pre class="highlight-code">
                            <code>
self.s3_client.create_bucket(
    Bucket=self.bucket_name,
    CreateBucketConfiguration={'LocationConstraint': 'ap-south-1'} # Replace with your AWS CLI region if needed
)
                            </code>
                            </pre> Note that <code>ap-south-1</code> was my default region, which you can check by using the command <code>aws configure</code>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">Step 10: Handling an Indentation Error</h2>
                    <p>
                        After fixing the above errors, I was then faced with a new <code>IndentationError: unexpected indent</code>. This was caused by an error when copying and pasting the code from the previous step. To fix this, I simply had to re-align
                        the code inside of that code block.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="color:#18a3c4">The Completed Application</h2>
                    <p>
                        After addressing all these issues, I was finally able to run the application successfully!

                    <p>
                        This project was a fantastic experience that covered a lot of ground. I not only got to build a useful application, but I also learned a lot about Python environments, how to call third-party APIs, and how to use AWS S3. It was a challenging process but
                        solving every issue was rewarding, and I hope you found this detailed documentation useful!
